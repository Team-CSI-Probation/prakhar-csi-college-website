                        participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to
                        as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several

                    <p>Debate is a process that involves formal discourse on a particular topic, often including a
                        moderator and audience. In a debate, arguments are put forward for often opposing viewpoints.
                        Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate halls,
                        coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies. Debate has also been conducted for
                        educational and recreational purposes, usually associated with educational establishments and
                        debating societies

                        A Student Design Competition can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical
                        competitions is to introduce students to real-world engineering situations and to teach students
                        project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually
                        require art and design skills.

                    <p>In a webinar, a presentation, a lecture, training or a similar content will be transmitted over
                        the Internet using video technology. A web conference software is used for this purpose, which
                        does not serve to transmit the event to the web, but can also be used for managing and
                        communicating with the participants. A webinar can theoretically only consist of audio data, but
                        it is usually a transmission of webcam images, computer desktop content or both.

                    <p> startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and
                        validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses,
                        including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered, startups refer
                        to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder.At the beginning, startups
                        face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be
                        successful and influential.</p>

                        cultural event at a college or university organised by the student community, involving
                        participants from other colleges as well.Professional performing artists are also typically
                        invited, and a number of competitions are held for students. Fests are usually funded through
                        sponsors, although some colleges have begun exploring the idea of crowdfunding.
